1) Make a directory for the backup of the eLog, GSU data, and Uniplast data. 
2) Put the backup scripts in their respective directories (backup.sh, backup_gsu.sh, and transfer.sh). You can nano into them to see what they're backing up. 
3) Edit the scripts so that they point to the right places on your computer, RCF, and phynp6. You'll need to make the target directories on RCF and phynp6
4) Open the crontab text file, edit it so that all the links point to the right places. 
5) There are also some log files to make. Just touch them into existence. 
5) Copy the crontab text file to /etc/ (probably need to sudo). There's one already in there, we're just overriding it with a new one. 

The only cron-based commands you should need are:

crontab -e (edits /etc/crontab)
crontab -l (lists what's in /etc/crontab/)
